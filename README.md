<summary><strong>Week Four - Iteration 1 (expand for details)</strong></summary>

<strong><h1>Saturday 6th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We had a meeting at 9:30 pm for an hour to discuss the contact of stakeholder, 
    getting a raspberry pi and ensuring that the sensors are working 
    and discussed what we should do for the rest of the week. </li>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner for the 1st iteration:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Scrum Master:<a href="https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial">Qarun Bissoondial</a></li>
        <li>Product Owner: [Michael Ali](https://github.com/irontarkus95)</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 1 1/2 hours</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Sunday 7th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today I researched on which technology to use between DigitalOcean and Firebase,
    made a written Document, documenting the pros and cons, pricing, 
    what they both are and their features. 
    At the end, I decided that using both is best, 
    where DigitalOcean would be used for computing and cloud services, 
    and since it needs a database to be integrated and managed, 
    I decided to integrate Firebase into it since it is the easiest to use 
    and we all have experience with it. It is also much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I also created a github organization ‘PiDronics’, 
    created three repos and made develop and feature branches for each of them, 
    pushing the code we had so far. </li>
    <li> We had a meeting for an hour at 9:30 pm to talk about the tasks we did and 
    discuss the results we came up with from our research.</li>
    <li> We decided to use real time db for Firebase, Digital Ocean after for computing, 
    React for the app.</li>
    <li> I learnt how to use git pages and learnt more about Digital Ocean.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked – 1-7pm</strong> (lunch was from 4-5)</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Monday 8th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, I researched on the different sensors needed for hydroponics 
    and the most effective way to automatically keep the environment optimal.</li>
    <li> I did not get to work as much as I wanted to as I overworked 
    for my job and it was really exhausting. I'm still learning to manage my time.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 5-6pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Tuesday 9th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, we met with our first stakeholder and obtained very useful information from 11-12pm.</li>
    <li> I also worked with Michael to set up the sensors with the raspberry pi 
    and ensure that it is working.</li>
    <li><strong>Hours worked - 6-8pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Wednesday 10th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, Michael and I could not attend UWI as he became horribly sick 
    and needed to go to the doctor :( </li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Thursday 11th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today Michael and I went to the doctor and did not get much done.</li>
    However, I still did some research on DigitalOcean and watch YouTube videos on how to use it.
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 6 - 7:30pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Friday 12th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today I researched on how to pull data from the raspberry pi into Firebase.</li>
    <li> I worked on writing the code to read data from the temperature/humidity sensor.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 6 - 9pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Saturday 13th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I watched tutorials and learnt some React to help out with the front-end.</li>
    <li> I tried to make the web app responsive and look good on a mobile app, but it was of no use.</li>
    <li> I discussed with my team, possible designs and ways to make the app look good on mobile while also being readable and neat.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 10- 4pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Sunday 14th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I did further research on how to make our system completely autonomous.</li>
</ul>

<summary><strong>Week Five - Iteration 2 (expand for details)</strong></summary>

<strong><h1>Monday 15th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner this week:</li>
    <ul>
        <li> New Scrum Master: [Gabriela Sewdhan](https://github.com/princesszelda94)</li>
        <li> New Product Owner: [Qarun Bissoondial](https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial)</li>
    </ul>
    <li> I planned out and assigned tasks for everyone for this week and made sure that we can finish it in time.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 9 - 12 pm</strong></li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Tuesday 16th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to pull the sensor values into firebase and into the web app.</li>
    <li> We worked on Milestone 3: Most of it was done already, we were not sure about the "proof of methodology".</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Wednesday 17th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We had a scrum meeting and discussed how to fix the structure of Firebase. We did a code review where Kristan, Michael and I reviewed the code and structure we used for Firebase and ways to improve it. It felt great seeing someone explain their code, I learnt a lot and feel like we should make code reviews a regular thing.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Thursday 18th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to test if the sensors we had could be submerged. It could not as our sensors do not work in a moisture rich environment.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We researched ways to coat the sensors and coated them in a shrink-wrap.</li>
        <li> We also discussed dipping them in thermally conductive epoxy.</li>
        <li> This outcome had me feeling down as Michael and I worked hard on our code to read sensor values and test them. However, this is just a minor drawback.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <strong>What I learnt</strong> => I learnt that before jumping into coding a physical component, I should do proper research first and ensure the hardware can be used for what I want it to. However, we only went ahead with those sensors at first as we did not know we were going to submerge the sensors at first. This information only came out to us after our first meeting with our stakeholder. </li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Friday 19th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Michael and I obtained the pi3 and tested out sensor code on it.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Outcome - The libraries did not work the same for the pi3 as it did for the pi2.</li>
        <li> We researched and found ways for our sensor code to work on both the pi2 and pi3.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Saturday 20th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to wrie sensor code to pull data from both the pi2 and pi3. </li>
    <li> I also unit tested the functions used in the sensor code.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Sunday 21st October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner this week:</li>
    <ul>
        <li> New Scrum Master: [Michael Ali](https://github.com/irontarkus95)</li>
        <li> New Product Owner: [Kristan Birbalsingh](https://github.com/KCB4Rockstar)</li>
    </ul>
    <li> We discussed what we completed for the week, what's left to do and problems we ran into.</li>
</ul>
