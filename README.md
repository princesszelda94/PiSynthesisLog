<strong><h1>Tuesday 23rd October</h1></strong>

<strong><h1>Monday 22nd October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We discussed changing our database from Firebase to a relational database.</li>
    <li> I conducted some unit tests to test the data types for the sensor code </li>
    <li> I included try except into my code to test if my libraries, methods and parameters exist</li>
    <li> I researched the code used and how to setup the Dissolved Oxygen and EC meters</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 10pm - 4am </strong> </li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Sunday 21st October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner this week:</li>
    <ul>
    <li> New Scrum Master: <a href="https://github.com/irontarkus95">Michael Ali</a></li>
        <li> New Product Owner: <a href="https://github.com/KCB4Rockstar">Kristan Birbalsingh</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li> We discussed what we completed for the week, what's left to do and problems we ran into.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Saturday 20th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to write sensor code to pull data from both the pi2 and pi3. </li>
    <li> I also unit tested the functions used in the sensor code.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Friday 19th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Michael and I obtained the pi3 and tested out sensor code on it.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> Outcome - The libraries did not work the same for the pi3 as it did for the pi2.</li>
        <li> We researched and found ways for our sensor code to work on both the pi2 and pi3.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Thursday 18th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to test if the sensors we had could be submerged. It could not as our sensors do not work in a moisture rich environment.</li>
    <ul>
        <li> We researched ways to coat the sensors and coated them in a shrink-wrap.</li>
        <li> We also discussed dipping them in thermally conductive epoxy.</li>
        <li> This outcome had me feeling down as Michael and I worked hard on our code to read sensor values and test them. However, this is just a minor drawback.</li>
    </ul>
    <li> <strong>What I learnt</strong> => I learnt that before jumping into coding a physical component, I should do proper research first and ensure the hardware can be used for what I want it to. However, we only went ahead with those sensors at first as we did not know we were going to submerge the sensors at first. This information only came out to us after our first meeting with our stakeholder. </li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Wednesday 17th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We had a scrum meeting and discussed how to fix the structure of Firebase. We did a code review where Kristan, Michael and I reviewed the code and structure we used for Firebase and ways to improve it. It felt great seeing someone explain their code, I learnt a lot and feel like we should make code reviews a regular thing.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h1>Tuesday 16th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I worked with Michael to pull the sensor values into firebase and into the web app.</li>
    <li> We worked on Milestone 3: Most of it was done already, we were not sure about the "proof of methodology".</li>
</ul>


<strong><h1>Monday 15th October</h1></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner this week:</li>
    <ul>
    <li> New Scrum Master: <a href="https://github.com/princesszelda94">Gabriela Sewdhan</a></li>
    <li> New Product Owner: <a href="https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial">Qarun Bissoondial</a></li>
    </ul>
    <li> I planned out and assigned tasks for everyone for this week and made sure that we can finish it in time.</li>
    <li> <strong>Hours worked - 9 - 12 pm</strong></li>

<summary><strong>Week Four - Iteration 1 (expand for details)</strong></summary>

<strong><h1>Saturday 13th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> I watched tutorials and learnt some React to help out with the front-end.</li>
    <li> I tried to make the web app responsive and look good on a mobile app, but it was of no use.</li>
    <li> I discussed with my team, possible designs and ways to make the app look good on mobile while also being readable and neat.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Although React Native would be preferred as you can deploy to both iOS and Android, React was extremely fun to learn. I already had some knowledge from React Native during my internship where I worked on the interface and design for a chatbot and dispute screen. I always feel at ease when developing front-end and I am excited to put in more work to the front-end.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>I gained a deeper understand of React and learnt from Qarun how to unit test React components and run the tests.</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>10-4pm - 6 Hours</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<strong><h1>Friday 12th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today I researched on how to pull data from the raspberry pi into Firebase.</li>
    <li> I worked on writing the code to read data from the temperature/humidity sensor.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>6-9pm - 3 Hours</li>
    </ul>
  
  
<strong><h1>Thursday 11th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today Michael and I went to the doctor and did not get much done.</li>
</ul>  

<strong><h1>Wednesday 10th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, Michael and I could not attend UWI as he became horribly sick 
    and needed to go to the doctor :( </li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Michael Ali had overbearing stress of driving to St. James to work for Monday to Wednesday and Friday, as well as driving to UWI for classes on Thursday. The tasks set out was too much for us to handle along with school and it affected Michael's health. However, our health is more important than a job and we should learn to prioritize taking care of ourselves.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Health is our wealth. If we die trying to win a nobel prize, we won't be there to reap the awards.</li>
    </ul>


<strong><h1>Tuesday 9th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, we met with our first stakeholder and obtained very useful information from 11-12pm.</li>
    <li> I also worked with Michael to set up the sensors with the raspberry pi 
    and ensure that it is working.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Our first stakeholder was Mr. Rakesh Bhukal, as lecturer and researcher at the Department of Life Sciences. We gained valuable information from him and realised that we were using the wrong sensors the entire time, as our sensors needs to be submerged into a reservoir. Therefore, Michael and I had to find a way to make the sensors submergible.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Even though the sensors we have cannot be submerged, we decided to still work on it for proof of concept and to further our own knowledge when it comes to sensor code and testing.</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>6-8pm - 2 Hours</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h1>Monday 8th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today, I researched on the different sensors needed for hydroponics 
    and the most effective way to automatically keep the environment optimal.</li>
    <li> I did not get to work as much as I wanted to as I overworked 
    for my job and it was really exhausting. I'm still learning to manage my time.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>I have a problem of being a perfectionist. I wanted to finish all my tasks fully for my internship to give a good impression. However, since every technology I had to implement was new to me, I spent many hours and days working on the same issue and overworked myself to exhaustion. I know that if I keep this up, I will not be able to focus on my school work as much as I would like to. Thus, I am trying my hardest to change.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>I found many different sensors we can use for Hydroponics monitoring. I also found the code to use for some of the relevant sensors - Humidity, Temperature and EC sensors.</li>
        <li>Management of time and prioritization of tasks that are due first, is extremely important to be successfull in life. </li>
    </ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>5-6pm - 1 Hour</li>
    </ul>


<strong><h1>Sunday 7th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> Today I researched on which technology to use between DigitalOcean and Firebase,
    made a written Document, documenting the pros and cons, pricing, 
    what they both are and their features. 
    At the end, I decided that using both is best, 
    where DigitalOcean would be used for computing and cloud services, 
    and since it needs a database to be integrated and managed, 
    I decided to integrate Firebase into it since it is the easiest to use 
    and we all have experience with it. It is also much easier to manage.</li>
    <li> I also created a github organization ‘PiDronics’, 
    created three repos and made develop and feature branches for each of them, 
    pushing the code we had so far. </li>
    <li> We had a meeting for an hour at 9:30 pm to talk about the tasks we did and 
    discuss the results we came up with from our research.</li>
    <li> We decided to use real time db for Firebase, Digital Ocean after for computing, 
    React for the app.</li>
    <li> I learnt how to use git pages and learnt more about Digital Ocean.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Even though we decided to use Firebase for the database for now due to the familiarity and ease of use, we will still use an SQL database after the course for our completed product.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>During my internship, I had to do many written reports and research on different technologies before choosing one as I worked with new technologies. This skill helped me to complete a written report for DigitalOcean vs Firebase very quickly.</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>1-7pm - 6 Hours (lunch was from 4-5)</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h1>Saturday 6th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We had a meeting at 9:30 pm for an hour to discuss the contact of stakeholder, 
    getting a raspberry pi and ensuring that the sensors are working 
    and discussed what we should do for the rest of the week. </li>
    <li> We discussed who would be the scrum master and product owner for the 1st iteration:</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Scrum Master: <a href="https://github.com/Qarun-Qadir-Bissoondial">Qarun Bissoondial</a></li>
    <li>Product Owner: <a href="https://github.com/irontarkus95">Michael Ali</a></li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Qarun Bissoondial was chosen as the first scrum master as he had the most leadership like qualities and will ensure we get our tasks done.</li>
        <li>Michael Ali was chosen as the first product owner as the idea is originally his.</li>
        <li>I am excited for my chance to be a Scrum Master as I love making and managing tasks and would love to be the leader of my team. However, I am still very shy and find it hard to tell people what to do. This is something I am currently working on and hope to improve throughout the semester.</li>
    </ul>

<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>

<summary><strong>Week Three (expand for details)</strong></summary>

<strong><h1>1st to 5th October</h1></strong>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li> We completed the user, system, functional and non-functional requirements.</li>
    <li> We also completed the uml diagrams and specification for the system.</li>
    <li> We had a meeting on Thursday in person to discuss what went on in class 
    and what Kyle said during the meeting. </li>
    <li> We discussed stakeholders, getting the sensors and the raspberry pi 
    and we set up other meetings to be held everyday where we would just tell each other what we worked on, our progress, and what we plan to do for that day.</li>
</ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Michael Ali and my ongoing internship came in handy for Scrum as we took what we learnt from doing scrum meetings everyday at work, and applied it to our project. Before I used to think once I get the product completed, that is the most important thing in software development. However, both my classes and work thought me that software development is not only about the code, but also about being professional, meeting deadlines, having sprints and scrum meetings, having or being a leader and organising tasks beforehand.</li>
        <li>I have also learnt that communication is of utmost importance.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>8 Hours</li>

<summary><strong>Week Two (expand for details)</strong></summary>

<strong><h1>24th to 28th September</h1></strong><p>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li>This week we met in person for a meeting, 
    discussed the milestones to be completed, the user and system requirements.</li>
    <li>We talked on whatsapp to discuss and complete milestone 1.</li>
    <li>We discussed how we will be meeting for the rest of the semester and decided to use both slack and whatsapp for messaging, and hangouts for video meetings.</li>
    <li>We discussed the skills each of us have and how it would fit into the project. Since Michael Ali and I had experience with the raspberry pi and sensors from doing research with Dr. Mohammed, as well as from mentoring for the DCIT Bootcamp, we were choosen for the hardware component of the project.</li>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>Since we had most of the tasks completed for milestone from software engineering 1, there was not much to do, which was beneficial to me as work was taking up most of my time.</li>
        <li>Even though automation was the most important feature for our product, we decided to take it our for the scope of this project as obtaining the equipment as well as time, were constraints.</li>
        <li>Even though my work would mostly be on the hardware aspect of the project, I have a passion for design and decided that I would also aid with the design and development of the app.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>This week we also discussed and gathered information for around 4 hours.</li>
    </ul>

<summary><strong>Week One (expand for details)</strong></summary>
<strong><h1>15th to 19th September</h1></strong><p>

<strong><h3>Tasks Completed -</h3></strong>
<ul>
    <li>This week we discussed on whatsapp, the project we would be doing. We decided
    to choose the same project that we started working on for Software Engineering 1 and HackAgainstHunger. </li>
    <li>We talked about:</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The importance of getting stakeholders</li>
        <li>Who are the Stakeholders</li>
        <li>Shared what we did for Software Engineering 1</li>
        <li>Discussed how to make the project better</li>
        <li>Discussed the importance of communicating with stakeholders to develop the system.</li>
    </ul>
</ul>

<strong><h3>Thoughts -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>I am very excited for the course as it is fully practical and involves developing a fully functional product that can be ready for release.</li>
        <li>I did however wonder how I would be able to handle both work and school as there was already enough pressure at work.</li>
        <li>I am very glad we continued with the automated hydroponics idea as I hope we can assist the world in providing a steady supply of food</li>
        <li>I am also very excited to work on more hardware as well as design and development of an app.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Lessons Learnt -</h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>User and Stakeholder feedback is of most importance when developing a product for customers. This was learnt in both my work environment and from class. Without stakeholders and users, we, as developers, would never be 100% what the customer wants.</li>
    </ul>
    
<strong><h3>Hours worked - </h3></strong>
    <ul>
        <li>This week we just discussed and gathered information for around 3 hours.</li>
    </ul>
